00:00:19,400	00:00:48,800	CHRISTOF	We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. We're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is in some respects counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards ... It isn't always Shakespeare but it's genuine. It's a life.	The Lunar Room
00:00:51,300	00:01:09,000	TRUMAN	I'm not going to make it. You're going to have to go on without me. No way, mister, you're going to the top of this mountain ... Broken legs and all.	Truman's Bathroom

00:01:24,500	00:01:42,500	MERYL	Well, I mean, there is no -- there is no difference between a private life and a public life. My -- my life is my life, is The Truman Show. The Truman Show is ... a lifestyle. It's a noble life. It is ... a truly blessed life.	Truman's Bathroom
00:01:43,600	00:02:01,600	TRUMAN	I'm not going to get to the top. All right, promise me one thing though: If I die before I reach the summit, you will use me as an alternative source of food. Eeeewwww, gross.	Truman's Bathroom
00:02:01,800	00:02:20,000	MARLON	It's all true. It's all real. Nothing here is fake. Nothing you see on this show is fake. It's merely controlled.	Truman's Bathroom
00:02:21,300	00:02:31,600	TRUMAN	Eat me, dammit. That's an order. Maybe just my love handles. I have love handles ..... little ones.	Truman's Bathroom

00:53:51,300	00:53:56,400	CHRISTOF	No ... hold back ... Fade up the music ... and now, a close up.	Control Room
00:53:57,200	00:54:01,400	KIRK	Years wasted. I'll make it up to you, son, I swear.	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:02,100	00:54:11,500	CHRISTOF	That should rewrite the papers, yeah. Okay, everybody, right uh, I hafta' say great television.	Unfinished Bridge

00:54:24,500	00:54:27,300	MOSES	Christof.	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:28,200	00:54:37,100	NET_EXEC	That scene just broke my heart! Well done, everyone! Congratulations! The TV	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:37,400	00:54:42,500	MAN_FROM_GIFT_BOX	Truman! It's television! Yes! Yeah! I did it! I'm on the Truman Show!	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:42,700	00:54:51,500	INTERVIEWER	But there's never been a, uh, as in the most recent breach of security the .. the first intruder to be a former cast member.	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:51,700	00:54:56,300	CHRISTOF	A dead one at that.	Unfinished Bridge
00:54:57,600	00:55:07,600	INTERVIEWER	I gotta' say, writing Kirk back in -- master stroke.	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:07,800	00:55:13,100	KIRK	Truman! Truman, no! That's off limits. YOUNG	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:13,300	00:55:19,500	TRUMAN	Why? What's up there?	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:19,700	00:55:34,300	CHRISTOF	As Truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island.	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:37,800	00:55:41,000	TRUMAN	I'd like to be an explorer. Like the great Magellan.	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:43,300	00:55:52,800	TEACHER	Oh, you're too late. There's really nothing left to explore.	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:53,000	00:55:57,000	CHRISTOF	Finally, I came up with the concept of Kirk's drowning.	Unfinished Bridge
00:55:57,200	00:56:01,800	INTERVIEWER	Most effective. Truman's been terrified of water ever since.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:02,000	00:56:18,700	CHRISTOF	When Kirk read the synopsis for the death at sea episode he was .. disappointed, to say the least. Uh .. I'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:19,700	00:56:22,300	CHRISTOF	Amnesia.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:23,500	00:56:32,000	INTERVIEWER	Heh. Brilliant. Let's take some of those viewer phone calls. Charlotte, North Carolina. You're on with Christof.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:33,600	00:56:41,500	MALE_VIEWER	Um .. yeah .. uh .. Hi, Christof .. uh, I was just wondering how many cameras you got there in that town.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:41,700	00:56:48,400	CHRISTOF	Somewhere in the vicinity of five thousand.	Unfinished Bridge
00:56:53,800	00:56:56,900	MALE_VIEWER	Oh .. Now that's a lot of cameras.	Unfinished Bridge
00:57:03,900	00:57:12,700	INTERVIEWER	And of course his eagerness to leave his mother's womb uh .. was the very reason he was the one who was selected.	Unfinished Bridge
00:57:12,900	00:57:41,100	CHRISTOF	In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies, the casting of the show, determined by an air date, Truman was the one who arrived on cue.	Unfinished Bridge
00:57:41,300	00:57:52,800	INTERVIEWER	Incidentally, uh, I believe Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation?	Unfinished Bridge
00:57:55,800	00:57:58,200	CHRISTOF	That's correct.	Unfinished Bridge
00:58:00,100	00:58:21,000	INTERVIEWER	The show uh, has generated uh, enormous revenues now equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.	Unfinished Bridge
00:58:21,800	00:58:36,000	CHRISTOF	People forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running.	Unfinished Bridge
00:58:50,800	00:59:17,500	INTERVIEWER	Mmm-hmmm. Sicne the show is on twenty-four hours a day without commercial interruption uh .. all those staggering revenues are generated by product placement.	Unfinished Bridge
00:59:18,200	00:59:54,200	CHRISTOF	That's true. Everything on the show is for sale. Actors wardrobes, food products, to the very homes they live in.	Unfinished Bridge
00:59:54,400	01:00:11,800	CHRISTOF	We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that.	Unfinished Bridge
01:00:12,000	01:00:42,400	INTERVIEWER	The Hague, for Christof, Hello. The Hague. (it's a bad connection) All right, we've lost that call, let's go to Hollywood, California, you're on TruTalk.	Unfinished Bridge
01:00:42,600	01:00:51,500	SYLVIA	Hi, Christof, I'd just like to say one thing: You're a liar and a manipulator and what you've done to Truman is sick.	Unfinished Bridge
01:00:51,700	01:00:56,600	CHRISTOF	Well, we remember this voice, don't we? How could we forget?	Unfinished Bridge
01:01:00,100	01:01:23,500	INTERVIEWER	Uh ... let's go to another call with --	Unfinished Bridge
01:01:27,500	01:01:42,400	CHRISTOF	No. No no no no no. It -- I -- It's fine. Okay? I love to remenice with former members of the cast. Sylvia, you announced so melodramatically to the world ... do you think because you batted your eyes at Truman	Unfinished Bridge
01:01:42,700	01:01:56,500	CHRISTOF	Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.	Unfinished Bridge
01:01:57,200	01:02:09,500	SYLVIA	What right do you have to take a baby an-an-and turn his life into some kind of mockery? Don't you ever feel guilty?	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:12,800	01:02:20,200	CHRISTOF	I have given Truman a chance to live a normal life. The world. The place you live in .. is the sick place. Seahaven is the way the world should be.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:20,600	01:02:23,800	SYLVIA	That's where you're wrong. You're so wrong. And he'll prove you wrong.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:24,000	01:02:31,700	INTERVIEWER	Well, aside from uh .. heated comments from a very small minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:31,900	01:02:35,000	CHRISTOF	Yes, for Truman and for the viewing public.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:35,300	01:02:45,300	CHRISTOF	Well, Mike, the big news is that Meryl will be leaving Truman in an upcoming episode, and a new romantic interest will be introduced.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:45,500	01:02:53,700	INTERVIEWER	Well, another television milestone  straight ahead on the show. It has been a singular honor and pleasure, sir. Great. Thank you.	Unfinished Bridge
01:02:53,900	01:02:55,700	CHRISTOF	Thank you, Mike. Control Room	Unfinished Bridge
