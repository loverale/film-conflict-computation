Ominous music builds. With a low chord, a car bursts through the curtain of snow. The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand·new blue Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales sticker still showing in its rear window. As the cars roar past, leaving snow swirling in their draft, the title of the film fades in: . []

From the studio audience: Audience Awooooo! []
[285.65 - 286.87] [THE KITCHEN] We track towards the back door. A curtain is stretched tig~: across its window. Jean pulls the curtain back . Bright sunlight amplified by sr.o~ floods in. A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock. She gasps, drops the curtain, turns and runs into-- A taller man, also in a ski mask--already in the house.

[310.50 - 312.52] [THEIR POV] Room empty, window open. Rolvaag strides to the window and hoists himself outside. Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, in search of the proper unguent. He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror. The shower curtain is drawn around the tub. He steps toward it. As he reaches for the curtain there is a scream and it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs. · Jean, tangled in the curtain, rips it from its stays and sturn=les out into the bedroom. Grirnsrud follows. []

[347.13 - 348.70] [PARKING LOT 25] We are high and wide on the parking lot of a one-sto::y offic~ park. Jerry emerges wrapped up in a parka, his arms stickin; stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. He goes to h:~ car, opens its front door, pulls out a red pl asr.ic scraper, and starts methodically scraping off tLe thin crus: of ice that hAs developed on his windshield. The scrape-scrap~-scrap~ sc~~j carries in the frigid air. Jerry momentarily goes into a frenzy, banging the s~rap;~ aga:~s: the windshield and the hood of his ca~. The tantrum passes.

[366.91 - 371.28] [BLACK 27] We hear the rumble of wheels on pavement. A headlit sign rushes at us out of the dark: WELCOME TO BRAINERD--Home of Paul Bunycn and Babe The Blue Ox. []
[371.78 - 381.76] [INT CAR] Carl is driving down a deserted stretch of highway. Grimsrud smokes_ and gazes out the window. From the back seat we hear whimpering. Grirnsrud twists around to look.

Let's keep still back there, lady, or we're gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya. Grimsrud hasn't moved. He looks slowly over at Carl. Carl Hey! I'll take care of this! Both cars have stopped. Carl looks up at the rear view mirror. []

Carl looks around as the trooper app~ars at his windo',ir;. Carl How can I help you, officer? The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time. Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out the window. Finally: Trooper ,... ,,,.. (_ This a new car then, sir? Carl It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell! Trooper You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window. Carl Certainly-- Trooper Can I see your license and registration please? Carl Certainly. Reaching for his wallet . . . . I was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya know, to be in full compliance, but it wi, it uh ... must a slipped my mind .. He is extending his wallet toward the trooper, a fifty dollar bill folded and protruding from the billfold . . . . So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd. Trooper What's this, sir? Carl That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance. He laughs nervously . . . . I was just thinking 1 could take care of it right here. In Brainerd. Grimsrud looks at him with narrowed eyes. The policeman thoughtfully pats th~ fifty into the billfold and hands the billfold back into the car. Troope:- Put that back in your pock~: please. 29 ,,,,. 30 The nervous smile fades from Carl's lips . . . . And step out of the car please, sir. Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head. There is a whimpering sound. The policeman hesitates. Another sound. The policeman leans forward into the car, listening. Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair and slams his head down across the window sash. The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside, throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car. With his free hand Grimsrud pops the glove compartment. He brings a gun out, reaches across Carl, and shoots--BAN~--point blank into the back of the trooper's head. Jean screams. Grimsrud Shut up. He releases the policeman. []

Voice Chief Gunderson? 84 l HALLWAY A handheld camera follows behind Marge as she walks down a brightly toplit modern institutional hallway. Marge is still wearing her outdoorswear; the nylon of shell of her parka goes SHWEBK-SHWEEK-SHWEEK as she walks. We follow Marge to a door marked HOMICIDE, and in. The large room has a counter behind which people work at randomly placed desks. Marge asks an officer at the counter: Marge Is Detective Sibert here? 85 Perched on a nearby desk is a woman sharing a loud laugh with the · officer seated behind it. She reacts upon hearing Marge and steps up to the counter, still chuckling. FOLLOWING Woman Chief Gunderson? Marge Yah--Detective Sibert? Woman Yah. Why dontcha come over ta my desk then. We are following Detective Sibert through the room as she talks casually back over her shoulder, without ever really looking back. Detective Sibert Well, Shep Proudfoot is now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large. Cup a. coffee? Marge Oh no thanks, I'm good. So somethin's goin' on. Detective Sibert Yah. I called his employer, this Wade She rises.

Detective Sibert That's wonderful. Mn-mm. That's terrific. Marge Oh yah, we're just, we're just on pins and needles. You have children? 86 Detective Sibert leans forward to turn two framed photographs to face Marge. Detective Sibert I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan. Marge Oh now he's adorable. Detective Sibert _,,. I He's three now. Course, not in that picture. Marge Oh, he's adorable.

[778.51 - 779.71] [JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE 87] Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form; beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy which he periodically checks. The carbon­ copy form shows thick, smudgy, rather illegible entries. Jerry hums nervously. Glass rattles as someone taps at his door. Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry. Marge is sticking her head in the door. Marge Mr. Lundegaard? Sorry to bother you again. Can I come in? She starts to enter. Jerry Yah, no, I'm kinda--I'm kinda busy-- Marge I unnerstand, I'll keep it real short then. Do you mind if I sit down--I'm carrying a bit of a load here. Jerry No, I-- But she is already sitting into the chair opposite, with a sigh of relieved weight. Marge Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering--Jerry Yah, like I told ya, we haven•t had any vehicles go missing. Marge Okay, are you sure, 'cause the reason we're concerned is that an employee here I talked to yesterday is now a fugitive from justice, and we know the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. So it'd be quite a coincidence if this employee and this car weren't connected here. Jerry Yah, I see. Marge So are you sure that car isn't--have you done any kinda inventory recently? Jerry It's not from our lot, ma'am. Marge But do you know for sure it's not from your lot without-- Jerry Well I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

Okay, I'll do a damned lot count! Marge Right now? Jerry Sure right now! You're darned tootin' ! He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabbing a pair of galoshes . . . .

Marge ,,. l l. 90 Could I use your phone, sir? Jerry is already gone. Marge turns back to the desk, reaches the phone over and punches numbers into it. She fiddles with a pencil as she waits for the connection. Marge Detective Sibert, please . .. With the eraser end of the pencil she plays with the clipboard on the desk. She twirls it around, drags it over to her side of the desk. . .. Detective Sibert? Yah, it's Marge again ... Yah, real good. Well I'm in Jerry Lundegaard's office, and there's somethin' goin' on here. Maybe you could run a CH on him. The form on the clipboard is from the General Motors Finance Corporation . . I'm pretty sure my car is from his lot here, and he seems--oh for Pete's sake. For Pete's sake. Her voice has gone suddenly flat as she stares off. [INT. CAP.]

GAEAR GRI?t$RUD 91 He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a little TV tray he has set up in front of an easy chair. He watches TV--the Sony Trinitron, which sits on the cart where the old black-and-white used to sit. Rabbit ears have been placed on the new set but its image--it might be a game show--is still heavily ghosting and diffused by snow. The audio crackles with interference as well. Despite the impenetrability of the image, it holds Grimsrud's canplete attention. With the sound of the front door opening Grimsrud looks up. Carl ,,-. is entering, his face still suppurating and raw. He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque laugh: Carl You should she zhe uzher guy! He glances around . . . . The fuck happen a her? Jean sits slumped in a straightbacked chair facing the wall. Her hooded head, resting on her chest, is motionless. There is blood on the facing wall.

Behind him we see the cabin door opening. Carl turns, reacting to the sound. 93 Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap, but no overcoat. He is holding an axe. Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun. Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the axe where Carl's shoulder meets his neck. ~GE In her cruiser, on her two-way. Through it we bear Lou's voice; heavily filtered: Voice His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday. Marge The day of our homicides. Voice Yah. Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs down to a large frozen lake. Marge And this guy is ...

We're looking. Marge Copy. And Lundegaard too. Voice Yah. Where are ya, Margie? 94 We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as of a chainsaw or lawnmower. HER POV Marge Oh, I'm almost back--I figured ~•d drive around Moose Lake on the way. Voice Oh. Gary's loudmouth. Marge Yah, the loudmouth, who knows. So they put it out, Lundegaard and Gustafson? Voice Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find •em. Marge Copy. Voice We've got a-- Marge There's the cart There's the car!

Wait for back-up! Marge is straJ.ning to look. The powertool noise is louder here but still muffled, its source not visible. Chief Gunderson? Marge Copy. Yah, send me back-up! Voice Yes ma'am. Are we the closest PD? Marge Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters. [INT. CAP.]
[792.78 - 793.52] [EXT THE ROAD] Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin. She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-lined hood. 95 For a moment she stands listening to _the muffled roar of the powertool. Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees, angling towards the cabin and the source of the powertool roar. [INT. CAP.]
[793.64 - 794.42] [ON MARGE] She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment of rest before slogging on to the next. The roar ia growing louder. Marge stands panting by one tree, her breath vaporising out of her snorkel hood. She squints down toward the cabin. [INT. CAP.]
[809.54 - 815.39] [HER POV] We can see past the side of the cabin into its back lot. A tall ,._ man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a large power tool l which his body blocks from view. ~GE Looking. [INT. CAP.]
[815.48 - 817.20] [HER POV 96] The man is forcing something downwards, which engages the roaring powertool and makes harsh spluttering noises. [INT. CAP.]
[817.31 - 819.48] [CLOSE RBVBRSE] On the man. The roar is very loud here. The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears. His breath vaporizes as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down on a shod foot, as you would press down on the shaft of a butter churn. Behind Grimsrud we see the woods, and movement. '6- )QRGE ~ Slogging down to the next tree, panting, looking. [INT. CAP.]

[821.37 - 823.52] [CLOSE ON GRIMSRUD] Loud roar. Eyes watering. Emerging from the woods behind him we see the large khaki-colored shape of Marge Gunderson, advancing, her right aI:m extended. 97 ~ With a grunt Grimsrud bends down out of frame momentarily, and reenters holding a thick log. He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine. ~ [INT. CAP.]
[823.86 - 825.05] [I] (_ Marge is advancing. We can now see the gun in her extended right arm. Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand. [INT. CAP.]
[825.24 - 826.86] [CLOSE ON MUGE] Breath steaming out of her nose, corners of her mouth drawn down in a grimace as she advances. One arm is still curled under her belly. [INT. CAP.]
[826.90 - 839.21] [HER POV] Hand-held track in on Grimsrud's back as he puts his weight into the log that pushes down into the machine. The dark shape in the snow to his side is the rest of Carl Rolvaag's body. [INT. CAP.]
[839.28 - 839.96] [CLOSE ON GRIMSRUD] Sourly at work as, behind him, Marge draws to within twenty yards. When she bellows it sounds strangely hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the roar of the powertool: Marge Stop! Police! Turn around and hands up! Startled, Grimsrud scowls. He turns to face her. He stares. Marge bellows again: . Hands up! Conscious of the noise, she show ■ with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia: ... Police! Grimsrud stares. ,... [INT. CAP.]
[840.01 - 846.21] [I] ,. ( 98 With a quick twist of his body he reaches back for the log and hurls it at Marge and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways, shielding her stanach. No need--the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands in the snow several feet short of her. [INT. CAP.]
[846.59 - 847.51] [PULLING GRIMSRUD] As he pants up the hill--slow going through the deep snow. Behind him: Marge Halt! She fires in the air. [INT. CAP.]

[872.50 - 873.10] [GRIMSRUD] He pitches forward. He muttters in Swedish as he reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg. ~ Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him, other hand now l (_ l 99 reaching under her parka and feeling around her waist. It comes out with a pair of handcuffs which she opens with a snap of the wrist. She holds them up near her ear, her other hand pointing the gun down at Grimsrud. MP.rge All right buddy. On your belly and your hands clasped behind you. [INT. CAP.]
[875.64 - 885.01] [THE CRUISER] Marge drives; Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed behind him. For a long moment there is quiet--just engine hum and the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams--as Marge grimly shakes her head. She stops shaking her head, but still looks grimly out at the road. Marge .. So that was Mrs. Lundegaard in there? She glan.ces up in the rear view mirror. Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. Marge grimly shakes her head. At length: Marge ... I guess that was your accomplice in the woodchipper. Grimsrud'a bead bobs with bumps in the road; otherwise be is motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out. Marge also- stares out at the road . . And those three people in Brainerd. No response. Marge seems to be talking more to herself now . . . . And for what. Pora little bit of money. ,,.. [INT. CAP.]
[885.43 - 887.44] [I] l We hear distant sirens . . . . There's more to life than a little money, you know. She glances up again in the rear view mirror. . . . Don't you know that?. . . And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out. The sirens are getting louder. Marge pulls the car.over. . . . Well. . . 100 She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling WHOOPS on her siren. She turns on her flashers. She leans back with a creak and jangle of · utilities. She stares forward, grimly shakes her head. We hear the dull click of her flashers . . . . I just don't unnerstand it. [INT. CAP.]
[887.49 - 889.93] [THE ROAD] It is snowing. The sky, the earth, the road--all white. A squad car, gumbballs spinning, punches through the white, approaching in slow motion. An ambulance punches through after it. Another squad car. [INT. CAP.]
[890.39 - 894.85] [HIGH ANGLE] A small motel, straddling the interstate on a snowy windswept plain. One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser. l«>TEL ROOM DOORWAY 1.01 ,,.. We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand ~neither side of the doorway, their hands resting lightly on their holstered side-arms. one of them raps at the door. Cop one Mr. Anderson. A title fades in on the screen: OUTSIDE OF BISM1JUC, NORTH DAKOTA After a pause, muffled through the door: Voice . Who?. . Cop One Mr. Anderson, is this your Fifth Avenue? Voice Just a sec. Cop One Could you open the door please? Voice Yah. Yah, just a sec. We hear a clatter from inside . . . . Just a sec ... J one of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back then enters--a superintendent holding a ring of key_s. This man turns a key in the door and then stands·away. The· two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel room. The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns. The room is empty. Cop One indicates the open bathroom door. Cop One Dale! The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace. A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window. The policemen holster their guns as they charge the window, and drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room. 102 ,,. His flesh quivers as he hyperventilates and keens in short peircing acreams. The cops wrestle him to the floor but Jerry thrashes in a palsied fit. Both policemen struggle to restrain him. Cop One Call an ambulance! Cop 'l'Vo You got him okay? Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts into uncontrollable sobbing. Cop One Yah, yah, call an ambulance. Jerry sobs and screams. [INT. CAP.]
[895.19 - 907.07] [A BEDROOM] We are square on Norm who sits up in bed, under the covers, eyes on a television set that sits at the foot of the bed. He absently munches from a bag of potato chips. We hear the low audio of a talk show. After a long beat Marge enters frame in a nightie and climbs into bed, with some effort. Marge Oooph! Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television. At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV: Norm They announced it. Marge looks at him. Marge They announced it?! Norm Yah. ,-.. Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay fixed , .... _ on the TV. Marge So? Norm Three cent stamp. Marge Your mallard?! Norm Yah. Marge Norm, that's terrific!
