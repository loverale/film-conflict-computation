The Lunar Room

CHRISTOF We've become bored with watching actors give us phony emotions. We're tired of pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is in some respects counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards ... It isn't always Shakespeare but it's genuine. It's a life.

Truman's Bathroom

TRUMAN (to mirror cam) I'm not going to make it. You're going to have to go on without me. No way, mister, you're going to the top of this mountain ... Broken legs and all.

The Lunar Room

CHRISTOF We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.

Truman's Bathroom

TRUMAN (to mirror cam) You're crazy, you know that? Interview  

MERYL Well, I mean, there is no -- there is no difference between a private life and a public life. My -- my life is my life, is The Truman Show. The Truman Show is ... a lifestyle. It's a noble life. It is ... a truly blessed life.

Truman's Bathroom

TRUMAN (to mirror cam) I'm not going to get to the top. All right, promise me one thing though: If I die before I reach the summit, you will use me as an alternative source of food. Eeeewwww, gross.



Interview

MARLON It's all true. It's all real. Nothing here is fake. Nothing you see on this show is fake. It's merely controlled.

Truman's Bathroom

TRUMAN Eat me, dammit. That's an order. Maybe just my love handles. I have love handles ..... little ones.

MERYL (O.S) Truman! You're going to be late!

MERYL I'm home, Truman! Look what I got for you at the checkout. It's a Chef's Pal. It's a dicer, grater, peeler all in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.

TRUMAN Wow. That's amazing!

MERYL Truman. Missed a spot.

Unfinished Bridge

MARLON Mm. That is a beer.

TRUMAN You know, I've been thinking about gettin' out, Marlon.

MARLON Yeah? Out of what?

TRUMAN Out of my job. Out of this city. Off this island. Out.



MARLON Out of your job? What the hell is wrong with your job? You have a great job, Truman. You have a desk job. I'd kill for a desk job. (re: beer) Here ya' go. (continuing) You should try stocking vending machines for a living.

TRUMAN No thanks.

MARLON Now there's excitement.

TRUMAN Don't you ever get restless? Itchy feet?

MARLON Where is there to go?

TRUMAN Fiji.

MARLON Where the hell is Fiji? Near Florida?  

TRUMAN (using golf ball as Earth) See here?

MARLON Mmmhm ..

TRUMAN (finger on one point of ball) This is us ... and all the way around here .. (finger slides around to opposite point) Fiji.

MARLON Mmmm ... (Oh ... )

TRUMAN can't get any further away before you start coming back ..... You know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human being has ever set foot?

MARLON hoo .. So, when're you gonna go?

TRUMAN It's not that simple. It takes money. Planning. Can't just .. up and go.

MARLON Right.

TRUMAN I'm gonna' do it. Don't worry about that. You

know, bonus time's just around the corner. 

MARLON Hmmm. Hey, you comin' for a drink? 

TRUMAN No. Can't ..

Flashback to Ocean

KIRK I don't like the look of that weather, son. I think we should head back.

YOUNG 

TRUMAN Oh no, Dad.

KIRK No .. we should go back. YOUNG

TRUMAN Daddy! Beach

TRUMAN Ugh. Ha ha ha ha ha! Ahhhhhhhh!  Truman Home 

MERYL You're soaked! Where have you been? 

TRUMAN I figured we could scrape together eight thousand dollars --

MERYL Every time you and Marlon get together

something --

TRUMAN We could bum around the world for a year on that

MERYL And then what, Truman? We'd be where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.

TRUMAN Maybe I feel like a teenager. 

MERYL We have mortgage payments, Truman. We have car payments. What? We're just going to walk away from our financial obligations?  

TRUMAN We need adventure ..

MERYL I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?

TRUMAN That can wait. I need to get away. See some of the world. Explore!

MERYL You want to be an explorer ... This'll pass. We all think like this now and again. Let's get you out of these wet clothes, huh? And into bed.

Truman's Mother's House

MOTHER It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman. I see him ten times a week, in a hundred different faces. You know I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.

TRUMAN It was dad. I swear! Dressed like a homeless man! And you know what else was strange? A business man and a woman with a little dog came out of nowhere and forced him onto a bus.

MOTHER Well! It's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown before we become just like the rest of the country.

TRUMAN They never found Dad's body. Maybe somehow ...

MOTHER Oh no ...! 

TRUMAN I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did dad have a bother?



MOTHER Truman, you know perfectly well that your father was an only child, just like you. No sweetie, you're just feeling bad because of what happened. You, sailing off into that storm .... But I never blamed you, Truman. And I don't blame you now.

Truman's Basement

MERYL What're you doing down here? 

TRUMAN Fixin' the mower .... I saw my father today.

MERYL I know .... (in response to Truman's paranoid look) Your mother called. You really shouldn't upset her like that.

TRUMAN Did you want --? What did you want?

MERYL (super happy) I made macaroni! 

TRUMAN I'm not hungry. 

MERYL You know .. you really oughta' throw out that mower. Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

The Truman Bar

WAITRESS (re: Truman holding red sweater) What's he doing?

WAITRESS See, they got rid of her, but they couldn't erase the memory.

LAUREN What's he saying? Truman, he's lying! Get out of here. Come and find me. 

LAUREN'S_FATHER Don't worry. We're going to Fiji. 

TRUMAN See you in school!

LAUREN'S_FATHER Fiji. We're moving to Fiji. 

TRUMAN Fiji ?..... (re: Sylvia's sweater) Sylvia! Hey! Truman Bar 

WAITRESS Well, why didn't he just follow her to Fiji? 

WAITRESS His mother got sick. Really sick. He couldn't  leave her. He's kind. Maybe he's too kind. 

WAITRESS I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.

BARTENDER Excuse me .... It's sad, we've already got this on the greatest hits tape.  

WAITRESS Can I borrow that?

Like, like .. at your company. There were people getting on the elevator, there was no -- there was no backing on it.

MARLON Heh.

TRUMAN I looked out, there was people there. And the- - on the radio, on the way to work, it started to, like, follow me around! Kept talking about everything that I'm doing! You know what I mean?

MARLON Now, Truman, if this is one of your fantasies, I've got no time to --

TRUMAN I think this is about my dad.

MARLON Your dad?

TRUMAN I think he's alive. Yeah. I'll tell you about it

later. I think I'm being followed.

MARLON By who?

TRUMAN It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.

MARLON How about those two?

TRUMAN I dunno. 

MARLON mm-hmm ...

TRUMAN Watch, it's those unpredictable actions ... (or they can't follow unpredictable actions ... ) Truman claps twice.

TRUMAN Anything happen? 

MARLON No.

TRUMAN Mm-hmm. We gotta' get out of here. You ready to go? 

MARLON No, I just can't --... I told you I can't.

TRUMAN (makes a disgusted noise) 

MARLON You're going to get both our asses fired, you know that. 

TRUMAN Okay, then! Let's do it! 

MARLON What?

TRUMAN Whatever you say! I'm game! 

MARLON What? What're you talking about?

TRUMAN Yessirree! Birthday comes but once a year! Hah hah ...

Beach at Sunset

TRUMAN Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever think about that, Marlon? That your whole life has been building towards something?

MARLON Nnnnn-no.

TRUMAN When you would haul chickens in the summer for Kaiser, what was the furthest you ever got off the island?

MARLON We went all over. Never found a place like this, though. Look at that sunset, Truman.

TRUMAN Hmm?

MARLON That's the Big Guy. What a paintbrush he's got.

TRUMAN Just between you and me, Marlon -- I'm going away for awhile.

MARLON You are? Really. 

TRUMAN Yeah.

Truman's Living Room

MOTHER (re: photo album) *sigh* Little angel .... Ohhh .. my little clown. 'N carrot top, remember this? Awww ...

TRUMAN We should be getting you home, mother. 

MOTHER Oh, hold on a minute, here's us at Mount Rushmore. Remember, Truman, when dad was still with us? It was quite a drive. You slept all the way there!

TRUMAN (re:Mount Rushmore) It's so small.

MOTHER Things always do dear, when you look back on them ...

MERYL Look, Truman. The happiest day of our lives.  

TRUMAN Mmmm ...

MERYL Look! Jean, Joey, Joanne ...

MOTHER Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman? Well, she still does! And there's lots of pages left over for baby photos. I would like to hold a grandchild in my arms before I go. And you know I really should be getting Truman to -- 

MERYL No no no no no, you stay, relax, enjoy yourself. Your favorite show will be coming on. 

TRUMAN You sure?

MERYL Besides, we have something to discuss ...

MOTHER A certain person's birthday ... 

TRUMAN Oohhh ... I see.

TV And there'll be another episode of I Love Lucy same time tomorrow, but right now, it's time for Film Classics. Tonight we present the endearing, much-oved classic, "Show me the Way to go Home." A hymn of praise to small town life where we learn that you don't have to leave home to discover what the world's all about. And that no one's poor who has friends. Full of laughter and love, pain and sadness, but ultimately redemption. We share the trials and tribulations of the Abbot family. Note the touching performance of Ronald Griereed (?) as Uncle Buddy. And that scene with the bowl of cherries is going to have you splitting your sides with laughter all over again. And there'll be tears, too, when David and Jenni-

fer are reunited. But enough from me, let's join the Abbots in _?_ Village. At this point, Truman notices Meryl crossing her fingers in one of their wedding photos ... Happiest Day?

Truman's Home

MERYL Thank you, sweetie.

TRUMAN I need to talk to you.

MERYL I'd love to, but, I'm really late.

TRUMAN What's your rush?

MERYL Surgery. There was that -- that elevator disaster downtown. It was on the news, last night. This -- this cable just snapped. This elevator ju -- it just plummeted down ten flights with nonunion workers. Just monstrous. You

know, that .. that building .. it's right next door to where you work. Can you imagine if you had been in there? It's not even worth thinking about. Anyway, I have an amputation on one of the young women who was .. in that  elevator She's very young. It's very .. sad. Anyway, um .. wish me luck.

TRUMAN (slyly) I'll cross my fingers for you. Hospital

RECEPTIONIST Ah, excuse me! Excuse me. May uh ... May I help you?

RECEPTIONIST I'll try. (giggles nervously) 

TRUMAN Can you tell her: I had to go to Fiji, and that I'll call her when I get there. 

RECEPTIONIST When you ... when you get to Fiji?  

TRUMAN You got it. 

RECEPTIONIST Okay .. um ... I'll tell her.

MERYL £ Truman? Honey, are you okay?

TRUMAN Yeah.

MERYL Truman. (starts to say something)

TRUMAN Eh! Shhh .... In just a moment, we'll see a lady

on a red bike, a man with flowers, and a Volkswagen beetle with a dented fender.

MERYL Truman.

TRUMAN Look !....... Lady ... Flowers !...

TRUMAN_AND_

MERYL And.

MERYL Truman, this is silly.

TRUMAN There it is! There it is! There's that dented beetle! Yes! Whooooooooooo! Ha-ha! Ha ....... Do you wanna know how I did that?



I'll tell ya'. They're on a loop. They go around the block. They come back. They go around again. They just go 'round and 'round! (almost singing) Round and round!

MERYL You know, I invited Rita and Marlon for a barbecue on Sunday. I'm gonna make my potato salad and --



TRUMAN I won't be here Sunday. 

MERYL -- I need to remind you that we need more charcoal.

TRUMAN Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

MERYL You're upset because you want to go to Fiji, is that it? Okay. Okay. Go. I think we should save for a few months, and then, go. There! You happy now? I'm gonna take a shower. 

TRUMAN Let's go now. I'm ready to go now, why wait?  

MERYL What?

TRUMAN Early bird gathers no moss, rolling stone catches the worm, right? Ha ha ha!

Driving in Circles

MERYL Truman!

TRUMAN Where shall we go? Where. Shall. We. Go? 

MERYL Truman, where are we going? 

TRUMAN I don't know. I guess we're being spontaneous.

MERYL Oh! (giggles nervously)

TRUMAN Somebody help me! I'm being spontaneous! Forget Fiji! We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?

MERYL (nervous laughter, quick glances directly into the camera) No ...

TRUMAN What about Atlantic City !?

MERYL Oh, no, you hate to gamble.

TRUMAN That's right, I do, don't I?

MERYL So, why would you want to go there? 

TRUMAN 'Cause I never have! That's why people go  places. Isn't it?

MERYL Truman. Truman I think I'm going to throw up. 

TRUMAN Me too!

Suddenly Jammed Street

TRUMAN Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchro-  nized, don't you agree?

MERYL You're blaming me for the traffic?

TRUMAN Should I? 

MERYL Truman, let's go home.

TRUMAN You're right. We could be stuck here for  hours. It could be like this all the way to Atlantic City. Let's go back. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

MERYL Truman, can you slow down? 

TRUMAN Yes, I can.  

MERYL Truman. Truman, that's our turnoff.

TRUMAN I changed my mind. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras, woooooo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hoo hoo hoo! Whoooohoo! Look, Meryl! Same road, no cars. It's magic! Hahaha!



MERYL You let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself you do it on your own.

TRUMAN I think I'd like a little company.

At the Bridge Out of Seahaven

MERYL Oh, Truman. You knew this would happen. You know you can't drive over water. Let's go home where you'll feel safe. 

TRUMAN (placing Meryl's hand on the wheel)

Keep your hand here, sweetie. Drive.

MERYL Truman! Tru -- Truman! You shouldn't be doing this, Truman, we're breaking the law. Oh God! Please don't _?_. Ahh! Truman! Ah! Hahahaha! We made it. Truman, we made it. We're over the bridge.



TRUMAN What?

MERYL We're over the bridge.

TRUMAN Ahhh!

MERYL We're over the bridge!

TRUMAN Ahhhhh, hahahahahahaaaa!

On the Road

MERYL (re: "danger: fire hazard" sign) Uh, uh what about that sign? 

TRUMAN I'm sure they're exaggerating. We'll be fine.  

MERYL What about that there? Would you believe that?

They drive through a 20 foot wall of fire.

MERYL Oh. Oh boy. Oh boy. Truman, we're on fire.

TRUMAN It's okay.

MERYL

We're on fire.

TRUMAN It's okay. It's just smoke! Just smoke. You okay?

MERYL Yes.

TRUMAN You wanna do it again?

MERYL

Noo!

TRUMAN Hahahahahaha ...!

MERYL Truman, stop!

Later, Down the Road

MERYL So, what're we going to do for money, when

we get to New Orleans?

TRUMAN I have my Seahaven bank card.



MERYL So, what? We're just gonna eat into our savings, is that it? You know, we're gonna hafta' call your mother when we get there. She's gonna be worried sick! I dunno how she's gunna take this.

Nuclear Power Plant Emergency 

TRUMAN What now?

EMERGENCY_CREWS (scream through a bullhorn)

MERYL Truman, looks like a leak at the plant.

POLICE

Back up, back up! Leak at the plant. We had

to shut 'er down.

TRUMAN Is there any way around?

POLICE Whole area's been evacuated.

MERYL Is there anything I can do?

POLICE No, ma'am.

TRUMAN Thank you for your help.

POLICE You're welcome, Truman.

TRUMAN (whispering slowly) Truman ...

MERYL Truman !? Truman !? Truman, come back! Truman !? Truman !? Stop him! Truman !?

In the Forest

TRUMAN Stay away !. Ugh! No! No! Men in radiation suits come out of the forest and capture Truman.



Truman's Home - Later

MERYL Thank you both so much for your help. I really appreciate it.

POLICE 1 He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.

POLICE 2 Next time we're going to hafta' file charges. 

MERYL I understand. Thanks again. Good night .... Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.

TRUMAN Why do you want to have a baby with me? You can't stand me.



MERYL That's not true! Why don't you let me fix you some of this new Mococoa drink. All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicuragua, no artificial sweeteners.  

TRUMAN What the hell are you talkin' about ?... Who you talkin' to?

MERYL (super happy) I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.

TRUMAN What does this hafta' do, with anything? Tell  me what's happening!

MERYL Well, you're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening. 

TRUMAN You're part of this, aren't you? 

MERYL Truman. You are scaring me!

TRUMAN You're scaring me, Meryl. What're you going to do? Dice me? Slice me? SO many 

CHOICES!

MERYL

Do something !!

TRUMAN What? What'd you say? Who are you talking



to?

MERYL Nothing. I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything.

TRUMAN You said "do something." 

MERYL No, I didn't.

TRUMAN Talk.

MERYL I wasn't talking to anyone.

TRUMAN Tell me.

MERYL Truman!

TRUMAN Tell me!

MERYL I wasn't talking to anyone! No! Please stop!

TRUMAN (re: knock at the door) Stay where you are. 

MARLON Truman ?.... Truman.

MERYL (crying) Oh my God ... How can anyone expect me to carry on under these conditions? It's unprofessional!

MARLON Everything will be okay. It's all over now. Unfinished Bridge



TRUMAN Well, I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm losing my mind, but .. it's like the whole world revolves around me somehow. 

MARLON That's a lot of world for one man, Truman. You sure that's not wishful thinking? You wishing you'd made more out of yourself? C'mon, Truman, who hasn't sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on "Sea-haven Tonight"? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?



TRUMAN This is different. Everybody seems to be in on it.

MARLON I've been your best friend since we were seven years old, Truman. The only way you and I ever made it through school was by cheatin' off each other's test papers. Jesus, they were identical. I always felt safe knowing that. 'Cause whatever the answer was-  

TRUMAN AND 

MARLON -- We were right together and we were wrong together.

MARLON Remember that time I stayed up with you all night in your tent, 'cause you wanted to play North Pole, and I got pneumonia?



TRUMAN (laughs) 

MARLON You remember that? 

TRUMAN You were out of school for about a month.

MARLON You're the closest thing I've ever had to a  brother, Truman. I know things .. haven't really worked out for either of us like we used to dream they would. I know that feeling once the good things just slipped away. You don't wanna believe it, so you .. you look for answers somewhere else, but ...

Control Room 

CHRISTOF Well, the point is, I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

Unfinished Bridge

MARLON The point is I would gladly step in front of traffic for you, Truman. 

Control Room 

CHRISTOF And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Unfinished Bridge

MARLON And the last thing I would ever do .. is lie to you. I mean, think about it, Truman. If eve-  rybody's in on it, I'd hafta' be in on it, too. I'm not in on it, because ... there is no "it." You were right about one thing, though ... The thing that started all this. 

(re: man standing in the mist behind Truman and Marlon) Yeah, we found him for ya', Truman. That's why I came by, tonight. I'm sure he's got quite a story to tell .... Go to him.

TRUMAN Dad. Control Room 

SIMEON Yes! 

CHLOE Bravo!

CHRISTOF That should rewrite the papers, yeah. Okay, everybody, right uh, I hafta' say great television.

SOMEONE Let's get some champagne up here!  

MOSES (a net exec) Christof. 

NET_EXEC That scene just broke my heart! Well done, everyone! Congratulations! The TV 

ANNOUNCER One point seven billion were there for his birth. Two-hundred-twenty countries tuned in for his first step. The  world stood still for that stolen kiss. And as he grew, so did the technology. An entire human life recorded on an intricate network of hidden cameras. And broadcast live and unedited twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week to an audience around the globe. Coming to you now from Seahaven island, enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed, and along with the Great Wall of China, one of only two man made structures visible from space, now in it's thirtieth great year, it's The Truman Show!

INTERVIEWER What a week it's been! I don't know about you, but I've been on pins and needles the entire time. Hello. And good evening. I'm your host, Mike Michaelson, and welcome to TruTalk, our forum for issues growing out of the show. But tonight, something very special, a rare exclusive interview with the show's conceiver and creator. So, come with us now as we go live to the Lunar Room on the 221st floor of the OmniCam atmosphere. That's where we'll find the world's greatest televisionary, the designer and architect of the world within a world that is Seahaven Island, Christof.

(to Christof) Before we begin, I'd like to thank you on behalf of our audience granting this exclusive interview. We know how demanding your schedule is and we all know how jealously you guard your privacy. This, sir, is .. indeed an honor.

Lunar Room 

CHRISTOF Don't mention it.

INTERVIEWER Well, the catalyst for the recent dramatic events on the show has been, of course, Truman's father, Kirk, and his attempts to infiltrate the show, but before we get into that, I think it's worth knowing that this is not the first time that someone from the outside has  attempted to reach Truman, is it?

CHRISTOF We have had our close calls in the past. Flashback: A Childhood Christmas

MAN_FROM_GIFT_BOX Truman! It's television! Yes! Yeah! I did it! I'm on the Truman Show!



Lunar Room

INTERVIEWER But there's never been a, uh, as in the most recent breach of security the .. the first intruder to be a former cast member.

CHRISTOF A dead one at that.

INTERVIEWER I gotta' say, writing Kirk back in -- master stroke.



Flashback: Truman at the Beach

KIRK Truman! Truman, no! That's off limits. YOUNG 

TRUMAN Why? What's up there?



Lunar Room

INTERVIEWER But let's remind viewers of exactly why dad was written out in the first place.



CHRISTOF As Truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island.

Flashback: Truman at School

YOUNG 

TRUMAN I'd like to be an explorer. Like the great Magellan.

TEACHER (a bit too quickly and pulling down a map of the world) Oh, you're too late. There's really nothing left to explore.

Lunar Room



CHRISTOF Finally, I came up with the concept of Kirk's drowning.

INTERVIEWER Most effective. Truman's been terrified of water ever since.



CHRISTOF When Kirk read the synopsis for the death at sea episode he was .. disappointed, to say the least. Uh .. I'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set.

INTERVIEWER But, how do you intend to explain his 22 year absence? 

CHRISTOF Amnesia.

INTERVIEWER Heh. Brilliant. Let's take some of those viewer phone calls. Charlotte, North Carolina. You're on with Christof. 

MALE_VIEWER (over the phone) Um .. yeah .. uh .. Hi, Christof .. uh, I was just wondering how many cameras you got there in that town. 



CHRISTOF Somewhere in the vicinity of five thousand. 

MALE_VIEWER Oh .. Now that's a lot of cameras.



CHRISTOF Remember, we started with just one. He was uh .. curious from birth. Premature by two weeks, it was almost as if he couldn't wait to get started.

INTERVIEWER And of course his eagerness to leave his mother's womb uh .. was the very reason he was the one who was selected.

CHRISTOF In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies, the casting of the show, determined by an air date, Truman was the one who arrived on cue.

INTERVIEWER Incidentally, uh, I believe Truman is the first child to have been legally adopted by a corporation?



CHRISTOF That's correct.

INTERVIEWER The show uh, has generated uh, enormous revenues now equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.



CHRISTOF People forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running. 

INTERVIEWER Mmm-hmmm. Sicne the show is on twenty-four hours a day without commercial interruption uh .. all those staggering revenues are generated by product placement.



CHRISTOF That's true. Everything on the show is for sale. Actors wardrobes, food products, to the very homes they live in.

INTERVIEWER And of course all of it available in the "Truman Catalog." Operators are standing by. Christof, may I ask you, why do you think that uh, Truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now?



CHRISTOF We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. It's as simple as that. 

INTERVIEWER The Hague, for Christof, Hello. The Hague. (it's a bad connection) All right, we've lost that call, let's go to Hollywood, California, you're on TruTalk.



SYLVIA Hi, Christof, I'd just like to say one thing: You're a liar and a manipulator and what you've done to Truman is sick.  

CHRISTOF Well, we remember this voice, don't we? How could we forget?

INTERVIEWER Uh ... let's go to another call with --

CHRISTOF No. No no no no no. It -- I -- It's fine. Okay? I love to remenice with former members of the cast. Sylvia, you announced so melodramatically to the world ... do you think because you batted your eyes at Truman

KIRK Nothing. It's dangerous, that's all. You've gotta' know your limitations, Truman.

CHRISTOF Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.



once, flirted with him, stole a few minutes of air time to thrust yourself and your politics into the limelight, that you know him, that you know what's right for him? You really think you're in a position to judge him? Do you-



SYLVIA What right do you have to take a baby an-an-and turn his life into some kind of mockery? Don't you ever feel guilty?

CHRISTOF I have given Truman a chance to live a normal life. The world. The place you live in .. is the sick place. Seahaven is the way the world should be.



SYLVIA He's not a performer, he's a prisoner. Look at him. Look at what you've done to him.



CHRISTOF He can leave at any time. If it was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him from leaving. What distresses you, really, caller, is that ultimately, Truman prefers his "cell," as you call it.

SYLVIA That's where you're wrong. You're so wrong. And he'll prove you wrong.

INTERVIEWER Well, aside from uh .. heated comments from a very small minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience.

CHRISTOF Yes, for Truman and for the viewing public. 

INTERVIEWER Well, Christof, I can't thank you enough for giving so generously your time tonight. I think it's safe to say that now that this crisis is behind us and that Truman is back to his old self we can look forward to some exciting new developments.



CHRISTOF Well, Mike, the big news is that Meryl will be leaving Truman in an upcoming episode, and a new romantic interest will be introduced.



INTERVIEWER Aha! 

CHRISTOF I'm determined that television's first on-air conception will still take place.

INTERVIEWER Well, another television milestone  straight ahead on the show. It has been a singular honor and pleasure, sir. Great. Thank you.

CHRISTOF Thank you, Mike. Control Room
